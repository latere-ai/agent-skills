# Spec-Implementation Diff

Compare what a dispatched task actually built against what the spec asked for.
This is the non-deterministic layer 2 of the task completion feedback loop —
it goes beyond the mechanical status flip (layer 1) to assess whether the
implementation truly satisfies the spec's intent.

## Step 0: Parse arguments

$ARGUMENTS has the form: `<spec-file.md> [commit-range]`

- The **first token** is the spec file path.
- The optional **second token** is a git commit range (e.g., `abc123..HEAD`).

## Step 1: Load the spec

1. Read the spec file in full. **Parse YAML frontmatter** — extract `title`,
   `status`, `depends_on`, `affects`, `effort`, `dispatched_task_id`.
2. Verify `dispatched_task_id` is non-null. If null, the spec was not dispatched.
   It may instead have been implemented directly in-session (no task UUID, but
   real commits on the `affects` files). In that case:
   - To **finalize** it (Outcome + status + README), use `/spec:wrapup`, which
     is lifecycle-aware and reconstructs the Outcome from the git history of the
     `affects` files. That is the canonical Outcome writer for the direct path.
   - To only **review** the implementation against the spec (no Outcome write),
     use `/spec:review-impl`, which works without a dispatch link.
   - You may still run *this* skill's divergence analysis on a direct-implement
     spec if the user passes an explicit `[commit-range]` (Step 2 then uses it
     instead of the task UUID) — but do not also write `## Outcome` here if
     wrap-up already owns it (see Step 6).
3. Extract the acceptance criteria from the spec body:
   - Design specs: items from Options (chosen option), Components, Architecture
   - Task specs: items from "What to do", "Goal", "Tests"
   - Any numbered or bulleted requirements
4. If the spec is non-leaf, read child specs recursively and aggregate their
   criteria.

## Step 2: Load the implementation

1. If a commit range was provided, use it directly.
2. Otherwise, infer the range: find commits associated with the dispatched task.
   Look for the task UUID in commit messages, or use the task's worktree diff
   via `GET /api/tasks/{id}/diff` where a task board exposes one; otherwise
   from git history over the spec's `affects` paths.
3. Get the diff: `git diff <range> --stat` for file list, `git diff <range>`
   for full changes.
4. Get commit messages: `git log <range> --oneline`.

Use Agent subagents (Explore type) to parallelize diff analysis across
independent packages if the change spans many files.

## Step 3: Classify each spec item

For every acceptance criterion or deliverable in the spec:

- **Satisfied** — the diff contains clear evidence of implementation. The code
  matches what the spec described (types, functions, behavior).
- **Diverged** — the item was addressed but the implementation differs from
  what the spec specified. Note *what* the spec said vs *what* was built and
  *why* the divergence may have occurred (common reasons: runtime constraints,
  API changes, simpler approach found).
- **Not implemented** — no evidence in the diff. The item was skipped or
  deferred.
- **Superseded** — the item was replaced by a different approach that achieves
  the same goal. Note the replacement.

For each classification, cite specific files, functions, and diff hunks as
evidence.

## Step 4: Identify unspecified work

Scan the diff for changes not traceable to any spec item:

- New files, types, or functions not mentioned in the spec
- Refactoring of existing code beyond what the spec required
- Test additions beyond what the spec's "Tests" section listed

Classify each as:
- **Necessary scaffolding** — required to make the spec work (e.g., imports,
  helper types, error handling)
- **Improvement** — reasonable enhancement discovered during implementation
- **Scope creep** — work that belongs in a different spec or wasn't requested

## Step 5: Assess overall drift

Compute a drift summary:

- **Satisfaction rate**: N of M spec items satisfied (percentage)
- **Divergence count**: how many items were implemented differently
- **Unimplemented count**: how many items were skipped
- **Unspecified count**: how many changes weren't in the spec

Based on these numbers, determine the drift level:
- **Minimal** (>90% satisfied, ≤1 divergence) — spec is accurately complete
- **Moderate** (70-90% satisfied, or 2-3 divergences) — spec is mostly complete
  but the Outcome section should document the deviations
- **Significant** (<70% satisfied, or major divergences) — the spec should
  transition to `stale` rather than `complete`, as it no longer accurately
  describes what was built

## Step 6: Write the Outcome section

`## Outcome` is the single canonical completion section, shared with
`/spec:wrapup`.

**If you are running as wrap-up's analysis engine (wrap-up Step 2a):** stop here —
do **not** write or update the Outcome, and do **not** touch frontmatter/status.
Return the classified findings (Satisfied / Diverged / Not implemented /
Superseded items, unspecified work, drift level, satisfaction rate) to wrap-up,
which composes the one Outcome and sets status from the drift. Steps 7–8 below
(tests, report) are wrap-up's job in that mode.

**If you are running standalone,** you own the Outcome — but still don't blindly
append a second one. Check whether the spec already has an `## Outcome`:
- **None yet** — write the divergence-flavored Outcome below.
- **Already present** (e.g. wrap-up finalized a direct-implement spec, or a prior
  diff ran) — do not duplicate it. Merge your divergence findings into the
  existing section (add/refresh the Divergences / Not Implemented / Unspecified
  subsections) and leave its Summary/What-Shipped intact. The divergence analysis
  augments the finalizer's Outcome; it does not replace it.

When writing a fresh Outcome standalone, append it before any "Future Work" or
"Open Questions" sections:

````markdown
## Outcome

**Drift**: Minimal | Moderate | Significant
**Satisfaction**: N/M items (X%)

### What Shipped
- <bullet list of key deliverables with file paths>

### Divergences
- **<spec item>**: spec said X, implementation does Y. Reason: <why>

### Not Implemented
- **<spec item>**: <reason — deferred, descoped, superseded by Z>

### Unspecified Work
- **<file/function>**: <classification and brief description>
````

Update the spec's status — honoring the lifecycle gate (`validated → complete` is
illegal; `complete` is reached only through `testing`) and the hybrid rule (prefer
a transition API where the repo has one, since it validates the edge; otherwise
a legal-edge frontmatter edit). A dispatched task reaching `done` means the **server** already moved the
spec along `validated → testing → complete/stale`, so usually you are only
recording the verdict, not setting the status:

- **Minimal**: the server's `complete` stands; leave `status` as is.
- **Moderate**: leave `complete`, but the Outcome documents the divergences;
  suggest `/spec:refine` to align the spec text.
- **Significant**: your analysis overrides the server's optimistic complete — set
  `status: stale` (`complete → stale` is legal). Recommend `/spec:refine`, then
  `/spec:dispatch` again for the remaining work.
- If the spec is unexpectedly still `validated` (no server hook ran) or `testing`
  (verdict pending), do not jump to `complete`: hand off to `/spec:wrapup`,
  which walks the `testing` gate properly. Never write `validated → complete`.

Set `updated` to today's date whenever you change the status.

## Step 7: Run tests

If the spec has a "Tests" or "Testing Strategy" section:

1. Run `go test ./...` on affected packages to verify tests pass.
2. Cross-reference test results against the spec's test requirements.
3. Note any spec-required tests that are missing or failing.

Include test results in the Outcome section.

## Step 8: Summary

Report to the user:

```
## Spec Diff: <spec title>

Task: <task UUID>
Commits: N commits, M files changed
Drift: Minimal | Moderate | Significant
Satisfaction: N/M items (X%)

### Satisfied
- <item> — in <file>

### Diverged
- <item> — spec: X, impl: Y

### Not Implemented
- <item>

### Unspecified
- <file>: <classification>

### Recommendation
- <what to do next — nothing, update spec, or mark stale>
```

## Guidelines

- This skill bridges the gap between "task done" and "spec accurately complete."
  The server-side hook (layer 1) marks the spec `complete` immediately. This
  skill (layer 2) verifies that claim and corrects it if needed.
- Be factual, not judgmental. Divergences aren't failures — implementations
  often improve on specs. Document what happened and why.
- Preserve the spec's existing content. The Outcome section is additive.
- If you can't determine whether an item was satisfied (ambiguous spec language,
  unclear diff), classify it as "Cannot determine" and flag it for human review.
- This skill is most valuable for design specs where the implementation had
  latitude to interpret. For task specs with precise "What to do" steps, the
  assessment is usually straightforward.
