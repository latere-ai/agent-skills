# Wrap Up a Completed Spec

Finalize the spec at `$ARGUMENTS` after all implementation tasks are done.

## Step 1: Verify completion

1. Read the spec file. **Parse YAML frontmatter** to extract `title`, `status`,
   `depends_on`, `affects`, `effort`, `created`, `updated`,
   `dispatched_task_id`.
2. **Detect the lifecycle path** — a spec reaches "done" two ways, and the
   Outcome source differs:
   - **Dispatched path** — a child spec directory exists (sibling directory with
     the same name as the spec file without `.md`), and/or leaves carry a
     `dispatched_task_id`. Execution happened elsewhere; the record lives in task
     files.
   - **Direct-implement path** — no child directory and `dispatched_task_id` is
     `null`. The spec was implemented in-session (often by `/spec:implement`,
     or by hand). There are no task files; the record is the git history of the
     `affects` files plus any in-session knowledge handed to you.

   Pick the path from what actually exists on disk, not from how you were
   invoked. Both paths run the rest of this skill; only the Outcome *source*
   (Step 2b) differs.
3. **Dispatched path only:** read all child spec files and parse their
   frontmatter. Verify every leaf spec in the subtree has `status: complete`
   (non-leaf children are complete when all their own leaves are). If any leaf is
   not `complete`, report them and stop — do not proceed with wrap-up.
   **Direct-implement path:** confirm the spec body's items are actually present
   in the code (spot-check the `affects` files / recent commits). If the
   implementation is clearly incomplete, report what is missing and stop.
4. Discover and run the repository's documented full verification command. If
   it fails, stop. If you just ran the equivalent full gates in-session and
   they were green, say so and you may skip the re-run.

## Step 2: Update the parent spec

Read the parent spec file and update it to match the completed-spec style:

### 2a. Run the divergence analysis (the shared engine)

Before writing the Outcome, run the divergence analysis defined by
`/spec:drift` (its Steps 2–5) as wrap-up's analysis engine — do not eyeball the
diff. This is the single place that classification logic lives; wrap-up composes
the Outcome from it, so the two skills never write the section twice.

1. Determine the commit range:
   - **Dispatched path** — the commits associated with the task UUID (per diff
     Step 2).
   - **Direct-implement path** — the commits on the `affects` files since
     `created:`: `git log --oneline -- <affects files>`.
2. Run diff Steps 3–5: classify each spec item (Satisfied / Diverged / Not
   implemented / Superseded), identify unspecified work (scaffolding /
   improvement / scope creep), and compute the **drift level** (Minimal /
   Moderate / Significant) and satisfaction rate.

If you are running `/spec:drift` standalone (not via wrap-up), it writes the
Outcome itself; here, wrap-up owns the write (2b).

### 2b. Write the single Outcome section

Insert one `## Outcome` section before any "Future Work" or "Phase N (Future)"
sections. This is the canonical completion record — both `/spec:implement`
(which delegates here) and `/spec:drift` (whose analysis 2a just consumed) feed
this one section, replacing the older split between "Outcome", per-task
"Implementation notes", and diff's separate drift report. It contains:

1. **Summary** — 2-3 sentences: what shipped, dispatched vs implemented directly,
   commit SHAs (or PR link), and the **drift / satisfaction line** from 2a
   (e.g. "Drift: Minimal — N/M items satisfied (X%)").
2. **What Shipped** — key deliverables: API endpoints and location (or "no new
   endpoints" if reusing routes), frontend components/stores/libs and approximate
   size, number of tests (backend + frontend) and coverage, key features.
3. **Design Evolution** — the **Diverged** and **Superseded** items from 2a:
   what the spec said vs. what was built, why, and the commit. If a deviation
   made the spec body wrong, fix the body inline too.
4. **Not Implemented** — the **Not implemented** items from 2a: each with why
   (deferred / descoped / superseded / blocked) and whether a follow-up exists.
5. **Unspecified Work** — the unspecified changes from 2a, each tagged
   scaffolding / improvement / scope creep.
6. **Decisions / surprises / follow-ups** — judgment calls not in the spec
   (naming, defaults, schema, UX micro-details, test strategy) with reasoning;
   gotchas a future maintainer or dependent spec should know (hidden coupling,
   fragile assumptions, test-infra quirks); concrete follow-ups not done here
   (link new specs/issues, or "None"). Highest-value detail — omit a bullet only
   if genuinely empty. On the dispatched path, mine the task files'
   `## Implementation notes` for this; on the direct path, use any in-session
   knowledge handed to you plus the commit diffs.

### 2c. Transition status through the `testing` gate (drift-aware)

The lifecycle forbids `validated → complete`
directly: a spec reaches `complete` only via `testing`, where the drift verdict is
rendered. The drift analysis from 2a **is** that verdict. Honor the gate; never
hand-write `complete` onto a `validated` spec. Always set `updated: <today>` and
keep `dispatched_task_id` `null` for non-leaf specs.

Drive the status by the path detected in Step 1, preferring the server transition
API (it validates the edge and runs stale fan-out); fall back to legal-edge YAML
only when the server is unreachable:

- **Dispatched path** — the **server already owns** `validated → testing →
  complete/stale` (the task-done drift pipeline; or, with `WALLFACER_DRIFT_TESTER`
  off, an unconditional `complete`). Do **not** re-set the status. Read it:
  - Already `complete`/`stale` → leave it; you are only enriching the Outcome.
  - Stuck in `testing` (verdict pending / tester failed) → use the
    `force-complete` action (it's `testing → complete`) only if your analysis says
    minimal/moderate drift; on significant drift use the `stale` action. Both are
    gates — confirm with the user before overriding the server.
- **Direct-implement path** — no task ran, so no server hook fired; the spec is
  still `validated`. Walk the legal edges yourself, using the drift level from 2a:
  - **Minimal / Moderate drift** → `validated → testing → complete`. There is no
    API action to enter `testing` from `validated`, so write `status: testing`
    (legal) as a YAML edit, then complete the `testing → complete` leg via the
    `force-complete` action when the server is reachable, else by writing
    `status: complete` (legal from `testing`). For Moderate, the Outcome documents
    the divergences; suggest `/spec:refine` to align the body.
  - **Significant drift** → `validated → stale` (legal directly). Do **not**
    complete it; the spec no longer describes what was built. Report this and
    recommend `/spec:refine`, then re-dispatch the remaining work.

### 2d. Update File Inventory

If the spec has a File Inventory section, verify it matches the actual files that were created/modified. Update any discrepancies.

## Step 3: Update `specs/README.md`

1. Read `specs/README.md`.
2. Change the status in the ASCII art tree (e.g., `◐  M4: File Explorer (N/M)` → `✅ M4: File Explorer`).
3. Change the status in the Milestones table (e.g., `**In progress** (N/M tasks done)` → `**Complete**`).
4. Update the delivers column if the implementation differs from what was originally described.

## Step 4: Check downstream specs (reverse dependency analysis)

Scan all spec files for `depends_on` entries that reference this spec's path:
1. **Reverse `depends_on` scan** — grep all spec frontmatter for this spec's
   path in their `depends_on` lists. These are specs that were blocked by this
   one and are now potentially unblocked.
2. If this spec introduced or changed interfaces listed in its `affects`, check
   whether downstream specs reference those same files/packages. Verify their
   descriptions are still accurate.
3. If a `stale` spec depends on this one, flag it — the completion may resolve
   or worsen the staleness.
4. Only make factual corrections — do not redesign other specs.

## Step 5: Commit

Stage all modified spec files and commit:
```
specs: mark <spec-name> as complete, update README
```

Do NOT push unless the user explicitly asks.

## Step 6: Report

Tell the user:
- The spec is marked complete
- How many tasks were verified
- Any downstream specs that were updated
- Whether any issues were found during verification

## Guidelines

- **Read before writing** — read the spec and all task files before making changes.
- **Preserve UX design** — the spec may contain detailed UX descriptions, wireframes, and user interaction flows. These are valuable documentation even after implementation. Do not remove or summarize them.
- **Preserve future work** — Phase 3, Phase 4, and "Future Work" sections describe planned extensions. Keep them intact.
- **Match the style** of other completed specs in the repo (e.g., `01-sandbox-backends.md`).
- **Be factual** — the Outcome and Design Evolution sections should document what actually happened, not what was planned. Read task implementation notes for accuracy.
